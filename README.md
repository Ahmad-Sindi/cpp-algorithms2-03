# Algorithm Challenge #3 – Perfect Number Checker
-
🧮 Problem Description
This algorithm reads a positive number and checks whether it is a **Perfect Number**.  
A Perfect Number is a number that equals the sum of all its proper divisors. 
Example: 28 → 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28

This exercise reinforces skills in loops, condition checking, and function structuring in C++.


💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Understanding the concept of Perfect Numbers
- Using loops to find divisors
- Implementing clean and modular C++ functions
- Strengthening mathematical reasoning in programming
- Validating user input for correctness


🧩 Example
-
**Input:**
Please Enter a Positive Number: 28

**Output:**
28 is a Perfect Number.
